# Terminal Startup Rice
### My Vision of The Tool
This tool is meant to greet the user of a terminal emulator with a pleasant picture and message that they can personalize.


This tool is meant to be called on the initiation of a new terminal emulator via the .bashrc file.  For this reason fish etc. alternatives to BASH are not yet supported.

### On the Radar to be Updated
- Changing Ascii Art based off time (i.e. holiday themes in December).
- Changing the color system to provide a better user experience.
